Allow the user to request an export of personal data and request erasure of personal data **from the account page**. This is an addon for WP User Manager.

## How it works

Once installed, a new tab called "Personal data" will be created within the **user's account page**. The user will be requested to type his current password before requesting an export of data or before requesting erasure of personal data.

Upon successful submission, requests will be logged under "Tools -> Export personal data" and/or "Tools -> Erase personal data" within your admin dashboard from where you can manage requests.

This add-on follows the way WordPress itself provides integration for privacy tools. The addon will evolve alongside WordPress when new privacy tools will be introduced.

## Email notifications

When requesting an export or erasure of personal data, the user will receive a confirmation request email with a special link that once clicked, will mark the request as confirmed in your dashboard so the administrators can either send an export of data or erase personal data.
